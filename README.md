chair
=====

this is a model of a chair that I made in Rhino.
the idea was to have the seat, arms, and back be well defined to meet comfy chair specs, and make a nonsense form around them to show them off.
meant to be cut out of cardboard.

modifying & building
--------------------

use the chair.3dm file to modify the form - it has a good layer setup for modification.
once you have a good form, copy the file to chair-join.3dm.
make sure the bottom surface is planar! good idea to create it using planarsrf.
join all the polysurfaces, and turn them to mesh.
once you have the mesh, FillMeshHoles, and export it to .stl.

I'm then using 123D Make to make a lasercutter template, using 24x18" cardboard sheets
important to have all the sheets aligned vertically to support weight.

I will include a pic once I cut this guy out - it's more than a hundred parts, so it will be some time.
